    question: "How early can I feel pregnancy symptoms?",
    answer:
      "Some individuals report feeling early pregnancy symptoms like fatigue, breast tenderness, or mild cramping as early as one to two weeks after conception, often before a missed period. However, many don't notice symptoms until they miss a period or even later. Common early signs include a missed period, nausea (morning sickness), fatigue, frequent urination, and breast changes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is morning sickness normal, and how long does it last?",
    answer:
      "Yes, morning sickness (nausea and sometimes vomiting) is very common in early pregnancy, affecting up to 70-80% of pregnant people. Despite its name, it can occur at any time of day. It typically starts around the 6th week of pregnancy and often subsides by the 12th to 16th week. For some, it can last longer. Eating small, frequent meals and staying hydrated can help manage symptoms.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should I schedule my first prenatal visit?",
    answer:
      "You should schedule your first prenatal visit as soon as you suspect you're pregnant or have a positive home pregnancy test. This first visit is usually scheduled for around 8 weeks of pregnancy. Early prenatal care is important for a healthy pregnancy.",

  {
    question: "Can I exercise while pregnant?",
    answer:
      "For most healthy pregnancies, exercise is not only safe but also beneficial. It can help manage weight gain, improve mood, boost energy, and prepare your body for labor. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Good options include walking, swimming, stationary cycling, and modified yoga or Pilates. Always consult your healthcare provider before starting or continuing an exercise program during pregnancy, especially if you have any complications.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much weight should I gain during pregnancy?",

General guidelines are: \n- Underweight (BMI < 18.5): 28-40 pounds\n- Normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9): 25-35 pounds\n- Overweight (BMI 25-29.9): 15-25 pounds\n- Obese (BMI â‰¥ 30): 11-20 pounds\nIt's best to discuss your individual weight gain goals with your healthcare provider.",
